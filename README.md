# TCP Client-Server Communication Project

This project implements a basic TCP client-server system using Python's socket module. The program allows the server and client to communicate with each other through text messages over a reliable TCP connection. The focus is on creating a simple, efficient way for two endpoints to exchange text in real-time.

## Features:
- Text Communication: Enables the server and client to send and receive text messages.
- Simple Setup: Easy to run and connect the client to the server.
- Reliable TCP Connection: Ensures messages are delivered accurately.

## Technology:
- Python and the socket module for TCP communication

## How to Use:
- install python or python editor on your device (<a href = "https://www.python.org/downloads/">for windows</a> | <a href = "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3&hl=en_US">for android</a>)
- Clone the repository.
- Run the client script and connect to the server. (Syntax : py client.py)
- Exchange text messages between the server and you.
